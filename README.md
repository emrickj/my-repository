This is a responsive standalone website theme using Bootstrap.  It can also use Font Awesome icons.  It is a PHP file which accesses `website.xml` and `website2.xml` which is stored in the data directory.  The file `website.xml` stores data from the main website.  The file `website2.xml` stores contents for the dropdown menu that is accessed on the last button of the website.  You can also store Contact Information on the Contact Us Page to a MySQL table.
